# Lecture Summary: CS 3305A  - Operating Systems: A Historical Perspective

## 1. Introduction

- Definition of Operating System (OS)
- Four pillars of OS:
  - Process Management
  - Memory Management
  - Storage Management
  - File Management

## 2. Historical Perspectives

- First Generation (1945-1955): Direct Input 
  - Run one job at a time
  - No reason for an OS
- Second Generation (1955-1965): Batch Systems
  - Programs written on paper in FORTRAN or assembly
  - IBMâ€™s OS/360 marked as a landmark operating system
  - Evolution of IBM's first operating system for their mainframe computers.
- Third Generation (1965-1980): Multiprogramming
  - Development of Integrated Circuits (IC)
  - Allows multiple jobs to be active at one time
- Fourth Generation (1980- present): Personal Computers
  - Personal computing revolution
  - Evolution of OS from the Control Program for Microcomputers (CP/M), DOS to MS-DOS
  - Introduction of first Graphical User Interface (GUI) with Apple Macintosh

## 3. UNIX Development

- MULTICS, the first large timesharing OS, developed jointly by MIT, General Electric, and Bell Labs.
- UNIX, a one-user version of MULTICS, developed by Ken Thompson and colleagues at Bell Labs
- Development of different UNIX versions: System V (AT&T) and BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
- MINIX or mini-Unix, developed by Andrew Tanenbaum

## 4. Linux Development

- Linus Torvalds, a student from Finland, created Linux based on MINIX and UNIX
- Linux as a notable success of the open-source movement.

## 5. Summary

- Reiterated the definition of an OS and discussed the brief history of operating systems
- Upcoming Lecture: Child and Parent processes
